# MicroThermocycler
-------------------------

MicroThermocyler is a project by Tobias Kuban and Matthias Bock.
It aims at minimizing a device that performs a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
within a standard PCR tube in an automated manner.
The device is intended for in-the-field PCR.

Our first prototype has four tube containers,
as we decided, a user would typically require four samples for one experiment.

This project is Open Hardware, see LICENSE.
